Hi, my name is Ika Nur Laily Fitriana, but simply call me Ika. 

I am a graduate student of Statistics at [Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember](https://www.its.ac.id/id/beranda/).

I love playing with data analytics and visualization, especially when it comes to data for the greater good. You can see my resume on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ika-nur-laily-fitriana/), or my social media on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ikanurlaily97).

Let's keep in touch! Drop me a message at ikanurlaily97 [at] gmail [dot] com. See you there :)
